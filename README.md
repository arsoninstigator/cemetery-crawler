# cemetery crawler !
cemetery crawler is my submission for hack club's hackapet ysws. it's a small game that's set in the abandoned graveyard on a dimly lit night. my "pet" is a baby grim reaper (who has grown up in a family of people who were grim reapers before him) with the world's responsibilities on his shoulders but still manage to get into some silly hijinks :D

## pixel art
the pixel art for this was made with a combination of aseprite (windows) and resprite (android)
